# anytime-tournament-bot

A Discord bot to enable mod-less anytime tournaments

# How to run
## Venv
To use the standard python venv module, just run the following steps.
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once this setup is done, you can run the bot by simply executing the main script:
```
./main.py
```
Everytime you need to exit from the virtual environment, just run the `deactivate`
command, and to enter again, before running the `main.py` script, remember to execute
`source venv/bin/activate`
